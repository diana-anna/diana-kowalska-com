Source code for my personal website.

** Prerequisites

You can download Hugo from snap by running

This project also depends on git submodules for the theme. In order for the
project to compile, you must run

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
#+END_SRC

** Local Development

To compile the website, running

If you would like to see the website while you are making changes, you can run

This will monitor for changes you make and update your local website in real
time.
